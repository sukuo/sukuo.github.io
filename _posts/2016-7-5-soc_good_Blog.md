#First week at Metis in the books!


#####By Sunne Kuo

So a little background on me - I recently quit my job without knowing that I'd be accepted into this highly competitive
data science boot camp so it's no surprise that the acceptance letter was a welcome sight.  In my former life,
I worked in the actuarial department of a large health insurer and while it was a good start to building a career,
the life was miserable between working and studying for these dry and cumbersome actuarial exams.  There comes a time when enough is enough and so I gave my former company my two weeks while in the middle of the application process to Metis and haven't looked back since.


The first week of camp was definitely a blur between meeting and getting to know my peers, learning and getting set up
on github, learning the lecture materials, working on projects and assignments etc.  But as things started settling
in my mind, I started thinking about how I can eventually use the skills I'm going to learn outside of a professional
environment.


Data scientists have this incredible skill set and ability that can be applied to a wide variety of problems. And while creating the next great app would be a great use of time and knowledge, wouldn't it be great if folks could devote a little time to doing social good?


This thought occured to me while listening to this piece from WNYC in the morning:


[New York attempt to fight street homelessness](http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-york-attempts-fight-street-homelessness/)


The problem is very apparent to anyone walking down the streets of Manhattan.  It is difficult to see people living in such conditions and it's clear these people need help whether they want it or not.


Home Stat seems like an poorly thought out program. The data as well as the methods they are using to collect it
don't strike meas useful or effective.  However the fact that there are workers out there collecting data to address
this issue is encouraging.  If there were data scientsts who could offer their expertise to help guide the data 
collection process and drive the analysis, there could definitely be positive outcomes resulting from this program.


I hope that there are like-minded data scientists out there who care about improving the lives around us and I'd be
very interested in hearing other's thoughts on using data science as a tool to improve the world we live in!
