#First week at Metis in the books!</br>

So a little background on me - I recently quit my job without knowing that I'd be accepted into this highly competitive</br>
data science boot camp so it's no surprise that the acceptance letter was a welcome sight.  In my former life, I worked</br>
in health insurance actuarial and while it was a good start to building a career, the life was miserable between working
and studying for these dry and cumbersome actuarial exams.  There comes a time when enough is enough and so I gave my </br>
former company my two weeks while in the middle of the application process to Metis and haven't looked back since.</br>
</br>
The first week of camp was definitely a blu between meeting and getting to know my peers, learning and getting set up</br>
on github, learning the lecture materials, working on projects and assignments etc...  But as things started settling</br>
in my mind, I started thinking about how I can eventually use the skills I'm going to learn outside of a professional</br>
environment.</br>
</br>
Data scientists have this incredible skill set and ability that can be applied to a wide variety of problems and while</br>
creating the next great app would be a great use of time and knowledge, wouldn't it be great if folks could devote a little time to doing social good?</br>

The concept came to me while listening to the piece from WNYC in the morning:

[New York attempt to fight street homelessness](http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-york-attempts-fight-street-homelessness/)

This program is rather ill conceived and the data as well as the methods they are using to collect it don't strike me</br>
as useful or effective.  However the fact that there are workers out there collecting data is encouraging.  I think that</br> if there
were data scientsts who dedicated some time to this program and cause,
