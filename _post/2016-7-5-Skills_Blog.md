#First week at Metis in the books!</br>
</br>

So a little background on me - I recently quit my job without knowing that I'd be accepted into this highly competitive</br>
data science boot camp so it's no surprise that the acceptance letter was a welcome sight.  In my former life,</br>
I worked in the actuarial department of a large health insurer and while it was a good start to building a career,</br>
the life was miserable between working and studying for these dry and cumbersome actuarial exams.  There comes a time</br> when enough is enough and so I gave my former company my two weeks while in the middle of the application process to</br> Metis and haven't looked back since.</br>
</br>
The first week of camp was definitely a blur between meeting and getting to know my peers, learning and getting set up</br>
on github, learning the lecture materials, working on projects and assignments etc.  But as things started settling</br>
in my mind, I started thinking about how I can eventually use the skills I'm going to learn outside of a professional</br>
environment.</br>
</br>
Data scientists have this incredible skill set and ability that can be applied to a wide variety of problems. And while creating the next great app would be a great use of time and knowledge, wouldn't it be great if folks could devote a</br> little time to doing social good?</br>
</br>
This thought occured to me while listening to this piece from WNYC in the morning:</br>
</br>
[New York attempt to fight street homelessness](http://www.wnyc.org/story/new-york-attempts-fight-street-homelessness/)</br>
</br>
The problem is very apparent to anyone walking down the streets of Manhattan.  It is difficult to see people living in</br> such conditions and it's clear these people need help whether they want it or not.</br>
</br>
Home Stat seems like an poorly thought out program. The data as well as the methods they are using to collect it</br> 
don't strike meas useful or effective.  However the fact that there are workers out there collecting data to address</br>
this issue is encouraging.  If there were data scientsts who could offer their expertise to help guide the data </br>
collection process and drive the analysis, there could definitely be positive outcomes resulting from this program.</br>
</br>
I hope that there are like-minded data scientists out there who care about improving the lives around us and I'd be</br>
very interested in hearing other's thoughts on using data science as a tool to improve the world we live in!
