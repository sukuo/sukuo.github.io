#First week at Metis in the books!</br>

So a little background on me - I recently quit my job without knowing that I'd be accepted into this highly competitive</br>
data science boot camp so it's no surprise that the acceptance letter was a welcome sight.  In my former life, I worked</br>
in health insurance actuarial and while it was a good start to building a career, the life was miserable between working
and studying for these dry and cumbersome actuarial exams.  There comes a time when enough is enough and so I gave my </br>
former company my two weeks while in the middle of the application process to Metis and haven't looked back since.</br>
</br>
The first week was definitely a blur between meeting and getting to know the classmates, getting used to the set up on</br>
github, learning lecture materials, working on projects and assignment etc... But as things start settling in my mind </br>
I start thinking about how I can eventually use these skills I'm going to learn outside of a professional environment.</br>
Data scientists have this incredible skill set and ability that can be applied to a wide variety of problems and while</br>
creating the next great app would be a great use of time and knowledge, wouldn't it be great if folks could devote a little</br>
to doing social good?</br>
